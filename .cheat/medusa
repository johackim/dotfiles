# Medusa allows username, password, and host data to be placed within the same file (the "combo" file).
# Possible combinations in the combo file:

# host:username:password
# host:username:
# host::
# :username:password
# :username:
# ::password
# host::password
# :id:lm:ntlm::: (PwDump files)


# To test each username/password entry in the file combo.txt
